<h2>Taking a more critical look at coding.</h2>

<p>To borrow a phrase, let's talk about The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.</P>
<p class="bold">The Good.</p>
<ul>
	<li> 
Coding is amazing in both its depth of creativity and satisfaction for 
building a solution that solves a problem.  
	</li>
	<li> 
The barrier for entry is low.  All you need is a text editor and there are 
more resources to learn coding from now than have ever been available before.   
	</li>
	<li> 
Programming has a false sterotype of being boring.  It's a great fit if you 
share the traits of a good engineer, like curiosity, logical thinking, 
attention to detail and most impotantly creativity.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="italic_bold">The Bad.</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is not a race to win in one sprint.  Our area of study is 
	constantly growing.  You must mentally prepare yourself for long term 
	goals when pursuing this as a career, skill, and outlet for your creativity.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="bold_underline">The Ugly.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When we think about coding, developers, or systems engineers, we 
	think of an ace that types out line after line of code and makes amazing 
	things happen with little effort given.  It sounds like magic.  The saying 
	too good to be true comes to mind.  The vast majority of Coders spend a 
	disproportionate amount of time staring at the screen trying to understand 
	why something won’t work versus writing shiny new code.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Well this just sounds negative you say?!  Not really.  The challenges are 
just <span class="bold_underline">opportunities</span> for us to find a better 
way.  The first step is understanding what some of our challenges are.  Once 
we’re honest in our self-assessment we can make plans to 
<span class="bold">minimize the impact of negative risks and amplify the 
reward of positive goals.</span>
